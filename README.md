# Enrique's Neovim Configuration

## Overview

Welcome to my Neovim configuration! 

Based on the [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) template, I've tailored it to suit my preferences while
keeping it open for anyone interested in trying Neovim. This repository is
mainly for myself, but feel free to try it!

## Pre-requisites

- **Neovim 0.9 or higher:** Ensure that Neovim is installed on your system.
- **[Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) as terminal font:** My favourite is
[this one](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/CascadiaCode).

## Installation

Execute this command to set up my Neovim configuration for Linux / MacOS:

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/emartinez-dev/nvimrc.git && cd nvimrc && ./install.sh
```

After the clone and installation, it will open neovim and finish the
installation, including the installation of treesitter parsers and LSP clients,
necessary for features like autocompletion and syntax highlighting.

### How to uninstall

Just remove this folders to uninstall anything related to neovim:

```bash 
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/ rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/
```

## Features

- **NvChad based:** Utilizing NvChad as a foundation for a powerful Neovim
setup.
- **Customization:** I've configured the template to align with my coding style
and preferences, but refer to the
- **Plugins:** A curated selection to enhance your coding experience.
- **Key Mappings:** Intuitive mappings for improved workflow.

### Visual customization

To change the theme, use the theme switcher `<leader> + th`. My favourite is `onedark`.
